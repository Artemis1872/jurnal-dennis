  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    I like science, technology, and movies. Aiming to become so called "Full-stack Developer" or "One-man Army". I was an independent malware researcher and kinda broke my PC twice. I'm trying to be good at Data Science and Competitive Programming. Currently studying <a href="https://cs.ui.ac.id/?lang=en">Computer Science</a> at Universitas Indonesia.
