Hello, world!

This has been my 7th attempt on making a "proper" blog. Although I've spent horrendous amount of time figuring Github Pages, Wordpress, VPS, Static Engines, designing the Front-end, debugging and etc.. I am still not statisfied with the progress. 

So far, the only thing I do is testing and modifying other people's work. I'm hoping that this site can be improved without revert back to zero *again*. And hopefully, able to make my own site from scratch.

So far, this is my favorite blog I've made because of the simplicity. Maybe I will try to improve the readability by changing some fonts, but hey it works now.

There are tons of contents I'd love to share with you guys. I wish you're excited with this blog. Both in English and Bahasa Indonesia of course!

You can also enable dark theme on the top-right corner if you don't want to hurt your eyes.

See you on the next post!
